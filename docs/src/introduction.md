# Introduction

A Few Words is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use notebook application for language learning. It is designed to help you pick up new words and phrases from webpages by one-click saving them to your notebook. The notebook can be a local storage by default, but you can also choose to sync it with your account on our cloud server. Besides, you can review all words you have saved in the notebook any time you want without leaving your browser even when you are offline.
