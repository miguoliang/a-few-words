# Terms and Conditions

This is a legal agreement between users of this service ("you" or "your") and the A Few Words author. This agreement governs your usage of A Few Words ("the service"). In this document, "we" and "our" refers to the A Few Words author, its staff, and trusted third-party contractors.

## Legal Age

If you are not old enough to legally agree to this document, please have a parent or guardian agree on your behalf.

## Privacy

Please see our privacy policy to understand the information we store when you use the service, why we store it, and the limited ways in which we share it.

## Account Expiry

As A Few Words is a free service, we need to periodically delete unused account data to keep costs down. Decks stored in your account will expire if your account is not accessed in 6 months or longer.

## Acceptable Content

By uploading or entering any material into our website, you assert that it does not contain:

- Content that you do not have the intellectual property rights to use, due to copyright, trademark, patent or other protection. Your local jurisdiction may allow you to use protected content under fair use provisions, provided you do not share it with others.
- Content designed to subvert the correct functioning of software or hardware, such as viruses and code exploits.
- Content that is illegal in Australia, Germany, the United States, or your country of residence.

## Access to the Service

You may access A Few Words directly through your browser.
As the service is provided to you at no charge, we reserve the right to suspend or remove your access to the service at our sole discretion.

## Violations & Law Enforcement

If you fail to comply with these terms of service, we may suspend or remove your account at our sole discretion. If your actions were illegal, we may also report you to the authorities. We will provide your information to third parties when required to do so by law.

## Money

Use of the service is currently free, and the hosting costs are supported by the free tier of some cloud services. As the hosting costs continue to grow, we may need to introduce a "freemium" model in the future, where basic accounts are free, and people can pay for accounts that support larger data or extra features.

## Changes

If we make significant changes to these terms, we will notify you via a message on the website, a message when you sync, or via an email.

## Transfer

In the event of a company acquisition, restructure, or bankruptcy, we may transfer these rights and obligations to the new legal entity.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

Use of the service is at your own risk. While we endeavor to ensure the integrity of your data, ultimately the responsibility is in your hands. Please keep a local backup of your data for safety's sake.

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". WHEN ALLOWED BY LOCAL LAW, WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT ACCESS WILL BE CONTINUOUS OR UNINTERRUPTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR DISCRETION AND RISK.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, INCORRECT DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES INCURRED BY YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THIS SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.
