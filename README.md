## Description

If you find recording new words from web pages to your language learning tools tedious due to frequent copying and pasting, you need this application.

This application consists of two parts: a browser extension and a server. The browser extension is used to capture new words and translate it into English automatically from web pages. The server is used to store the captured content and its translation in a database and provide an API for the browser extension to retrieve the translation.
