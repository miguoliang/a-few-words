## Description

If you find recording new words from web pages to your language learning tools tedious due to frequent copying and pasting, you need this application.

This application consists of two parts: a browser extension and a server. The browser extension is used to capture new words and translate it into English automatically from web pages. The server is used to store the captured content and its translation in a database and provide an API for the browser extension to retrieve the translation.

## Roadmap

- [x] Users can capture new words from web pages by clicking the menu item in the context menu.
- [x] Users can login to the web app and view the captured words.
- [ ] Users can review words and mark them as learned or not learned in both of web app and Chrome extension.
- [ ] The application provides a forgetting curve algorithm implementation to help users practice words.
