## Description

If you find recording new words from web pages to your language learning tools tedious due to frequent copying and pasting, you need this application. Only one click is needed to capture a word with its translation and the source URL automatically.

This application consists of two parts: a browser extension and a web app. The browser extension is used to capture new words and translate it into English automatically from web pages. The web app is used to browse, remove, review, mark as learned, and practice words.

But the words are translated into Chinese currently. I will add more languages in the future.

## Roadmap

### Version 1.0.0 (Expected by the end of 2024)

- [x] Users can capture new words from web pages by clicking the menu item in the context menu.
- [ ] Users can browse and remove the captured words in both of web app and Chrome extension.
- [ ] Users can review words and mark them as learned or not learned in both of web app and Chrome extension.
- [ ] Users can practice words with the help of the application's forgetting curve algorithm implementation.
- [ ] Users can trace their learning progress in both of web app and Chrome extension.
- [ ] Users can trace their usage of the application in both of web app and Chrome extension.

### Future
